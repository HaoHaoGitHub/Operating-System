# Multi-threading in C using Pthreads
## Introduction
In this project, I used C and the POSIX thread (Pthread) library to implement a single-process multi-threaded
text manipulation program. The goal is to work with threads and synchronization.

Overall, my program will open and read a directory of text files, parse all words from all of these files, 
store each parsed word into a dynamically allocated array, then display words that contain a specific substring.
